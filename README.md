> **A simple cross-platform notepad. Based on Qt and C++.**


Just practice XD

🚧 WIP

BTW you can read this post in my blog: [Notepanda 开发小结](https://chungzh.cn/2020/05/16/notepanda/)

## Why write this text editor?

I recently started getting started with Qt, this is my first Qt project, the first C++ project, and the first project in my life. I hope to develop my skills through this project.

I'm not going to use this as a replacement for my other text editors because it's too simple and I am too poor :)

So enjoy this toy 🍵️
